# 1 ) A train runnig at the speed of 60km/h crosses a pole in 9 sec . what is the lenth of the train ?

- Ans 60*5/18 = 300/18 m/sec = 50/3 m/sec
  length of the train = speed* time
  -> 50/3\*9 m = 150 m

# 2 ) A train 125 m long passes a man , running at 5km/h in the same derection in which the train is going , in 10 sec . the speed of the train ?

- Ans -> speed of train 125/10 m/sec --> 5 to devide both numbers 25/2 m/sec
  25/2 * 18/5 = 5*9 = 45 km/h
  the speed of the train be x km/h
  x-5 = 45
  x = 45+5 => 50 km/h

# 3 ) The length of the bridge, which a train 130 metres long and travelling at 45 km/hr can cross in 30 seconds ?

- Ans -> speed = 45*5/18 = 5*5/2 = 25/2 m/sec
  lenth of the bridge be x meter
  130+x/30 = 25/2
  =>260 + 2x = 750
  => 2x = 750 - 260
  => 2x = 490
  => x = 490/2
  => x = 245 m

# 4 ) Two trains running in opposite directions cross a man standing on the platform in 27 seconds and 17 seconds respectively and they cross each other in 23 seconds. The ratio of their speeds ?

- Ans -> the speed of two trains be x m/sec and y m/sec
  length of first train = 27x m
  length of second train = 17y m

            27x + 17y/x + y = 23
            => 27x + 17y = 23x + 23y
            => 27x - 23x = 23y - 17y
            => 4x = 6y
            => x/y = 6/4
            => x : y = 3 : 2

# 5 ) A train passes a station platform in 36 seconds and a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds. If the speed of the train is 54 km/hr, what is the length of the platform?

- Ans -> 54 * 5 / 18 => 27*5 / 9 m/sec
  => 3 * 5 = 15 m/sec
  => lenth of the train 15*20 = 300m
  => length of platform be x meter
  => x + 300 / 36 = 15
  => x + 300 = 540
  => x = 240 meter

# 6 ) A train 240 m long passes a pole in 24 seconds. How long will it take to pass a platform 650 m long?

- Ans -> speed = 240/24 => 10 m/sec
  => required time = 240 + 650 / 10
  => 890/10 cross one 0 to one 0 cross and totel sec passes a pole in 89 sec

# 7 ) Two trains of equal length are running on parallel lines in the same direction at 46 km/hr and 36 km/hr. The faster train passes the slower train in 36 seconds. The length of each train

- Ans -> length of each train be x meter
  and coverd distance = 2x meter
  relative speed = 46-36 = 10
  10*5/18 => 5*5/9 => 25/9 m/sec
  => 2x/36 = 25/9 => 2x/4 = 25/1
  => 2x*1 = 25 * 4
  => 2x = 100
  => x = 100/2
  => x = 50

# 8 ) A train 360 m long is running at a speed of 45 km/hr. In what time will it pass a bridge 140 m long?

- Ans -> speed 45 * 5 /18 m/sec
  => devide 9 to 45 and 18
  => 5*5/2 = 25/2 m/sec
  => totel distance coverd to be 360+140 = 500m
  => distance/ speed
  => 500 * 2 /25
  => cross 25 to 500 and will be ans is
  => 20 *2 = 40 sec

# 9 ) Two trains are moving in opposite directions @ 60 km/hr and 90 km/hr. Their lengths are 1.10 km and 0.9 km respectively. The time taken by the slower train to cross the faster train in seconds

- Ans -> Relative speed = 60+90 = 150 km/h
  => 150*5/18 => 25*5/3
  => 125/3 m/sec
  => distance covered 1.10+0.9 = 2.0 km
  => 2.0km = 2000 meter
  => required time = 2000*3/125
  => divide by 25
  => 80*3/5
  => divide by 5
  => 16\*3
  => 48 sec

# 10 ) A jogger running at 9 kmph alongside a railway track in 240 metres ahead of the engine of a 120 metres long train running at 45 kmph in the same direction. In how much time will the train pass the jogger?

- Ans -> speed to train relative to jogger = 45-9 => 36 km/h
  => 36*5/18
  => 2*5
  => 10 m/sec
  => distance to be covered 240+ 120 = 360 meter
  => time taken = 360/10
  => 36 sec

# 11 ) A 270 metres long train running at the speed of 120 kmph crosses another train running in opposite direction at the speed of 80 kmph in 9 seconds. What is the length of the other train?

- Ans -> Realative speed = 120+80 = 200 km/hr
  => 200*5/18 = 100*5/9
  => 500/9 m/sec
  length of the train to be x meter
  => x + 270 / 9 = 500/9
  => cross 9 to 9
  => x + 270 = 500
  => x = 500 - 270
  => x = 230

# 12 ) A goods train runs at the speed of 72 kmph and crosses a 250 m long platform in 26 seconds. What is the length of the goods train?

- Ans -> speed = 72*5/18 m/sec
  => divide into 9
  => 8*5/2 m/sec
  => 40/2 m/sec
  => 20 m/sec
  time = 26 sec
  the length of the train to be x meter
  then , x + 250 / 26 = 20
  => x + 250 = 26\*20
  => x + 250 = 520
  => x = 520 - 250
  => x = 270

# 13 ) Two trains, each 100 m long, moving in opposite directions, cross each other in 8 seconds. If one is moving twice as fast the other, then the speed of the faster train ?

- Ans -> the speed of the slower train = x meter/sec
  the speed of the faster train = 2x meter/sec
  relative speed = x + 2x = 3x m/sec
  two train each 100 m
  => 100 + 100/8 = 3x
  => 100+100 = 24x
  => 24x = 200
  => x = 200/24
  => x = 100/12 => 50/6 => 25/3 m/sec
  sped of faster train = 50/3 m/sec
  moving of opposite derection = x*18/5
  => 50/3 * 18/5 km/hr
  => 5 to divide into 50 = 10
  => 180 / 3
  => 60 km/hr

# 14 ) Two trains 140 m and 160 m long run at the speed of 60 km/hr and 40 km/hr respectively in opposite directions on parallel tracks. The time (in seconds) which they take to cross each other

- Ans -> relative speed = 60 + 40 km/hr = 100 km /hr
  => 100*5/18 km/hr
  => 50*5/9 km /hr
  => 250/9 km /hr
  => Distance covered in crossing each other = 140+160 = 300 m
  => required time = 300*9/250 sec
  => 6*9/5 sec
  => 54/5 sec
  => 10.8 sec

# 15 ) A train 110 metres long is running with a speed of 60 kmph. In what time will it pass a man who is running at 6 kmph in the direction opposite to that in which the train is going?

- Ans -> speed of train to relative man = 60 + 6 = 66 km .hr
  => 66*5/18 m /sec
  => divide into 9
  => 33*5/9 m/sec
  => divide into 3
  => 11*5/3 m/sec
  => 55/3 m/sec
  time taken to pass the man 110*3/55 sec
  => divide into 5
  => 22*3/11 sec
  => 22 to divide into 11
  => 2*3 sec
  => 6 sec
