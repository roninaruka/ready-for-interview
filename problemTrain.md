# 1 ) A train runnig at the speed of 60km/h crosses a pole in 9 sec . what is the lenth of the train ?

- Ans 60*5/18 = 300/18 m/sec = 50/3 m/sec
  length of the train = speed* time
  -> 50/3\*9 m = 150 m

# 2 ) A train 125 m long passes a man , running at 5km/h in the same derection in which the train is going , in 10 sec . the speed of the train ?

- Ans -> speed of train 125/10 m/sec --> 5 to devide both numbers 25/2 m/sec
  25/2 * 18/5 = 5*9 = 45 km/h
  the speed of the train be x km/h

  length of first train = 27x m
  length of second train = 17y m

            27x + 17y/x + y = 23
            => 27x + 17y = 23x + 23y
            => 27x - 23x = 23y - 17y
            => 4x = 6y
            => x/y = 6/4
            => x : y = 3 : 2
